# Reveal Scalacon

This is the base template for [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) that we use to Scalacon.

## First step

1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

2. Launch the server: `npm start`

## Markdown
We use markdown. To add the content, you must update the `slides/01.md`. In this file, we have a list of all the html elements that you can use in the talk.

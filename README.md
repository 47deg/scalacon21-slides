# Scalacon Slides
For our event we have prepared 3 basic templates with the colors and fonts of our conference that you can use for your talk. The platforms we have used are

- Reveal.js
- Google Slides
- Keynotes

## Reveal.js

This is the base template for [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) that you can use in your talk.

We use markdown. To add the content, you must update the `slides/01.md`. In this file, we have a list of all the html elements that you can use in the talk. [You can see it here](https://47deg.github.io/scalacon21-slides/)
